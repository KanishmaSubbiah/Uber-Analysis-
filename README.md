                                              Uber Analysis Project Documentation

Project Overview:
  This project analyzes Uber ride data to gain insights into ride patterns, trip distances, and fare amounts. The dataset includes information about ride durations, locations, and purposes.
Data Preparation:
1.	Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2.	Renaming Columns: Columns are renamed for clarity.
3.	Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the 'Purpose' column are filled forward.
4.	Date and Time Conversion: Start and end dates are converted to datetime format.

Feature Engineering:
1.	Extracted date and time components (year, month, day, hour, minute).
2.	Calculate trip duration in minutes.
3.	Converted miles to kilometers.
4.	Calculated speed (miles per minute).

Exploratory Data Analysis:
1.	Rides Distribution: Plots showing the distribution of rides across months, categories, and purposes.
2.	Trip Characteristics: Histograms for miles traveled and trip durations.
3.	Correlation Analysis: Heatmap to visualize correlations among variables.
4.	Day Distribution: Count plot for ride distribution across different days of the week.

Visualizations
1.	Ride Counts by Month: Line plot showing monthly ride counts and maximum miles traveled.
2.	Total Miles by Hour: Bar and line plots for total miles traveled by hour of the day.
3.	Purpose by Category: Count plot illustrating purposes categorized by ride type.
4.	Fare Analysis: Scatter plot of trip distance versus calculated fare amounts.
5.	Trip Purpose Distribution: Pie chart showing the distribution of trips by purpose.
6.	Trip Distance by Day of Week: Box plot displaying trip distances categorized by day of the week.
Conclusion:
The analysis provides insights into Uber ride patterns, aiding in resource allocation and strategic decision-making.
